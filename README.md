# Sudoku Solver

## About
This application was created as a means of playing & solving sudoku games. Users can either upload a text file containing a sudoku grid (the format is any 3x3 grid of numbers between 0 and 9 - with or without spaces), or they can input a grid into the application using the 'Create Grid' Feature.

The code for the sudoku-solving algorithm used in this application was originally developed in Java, but it was later updated to JavaScript in order to implement the algorithm in a web-application using React.
