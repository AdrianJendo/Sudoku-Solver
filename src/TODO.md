1. After each addition to user sudoku board, check if sudoku is solvable. If solvable, tell the user that this grid is solvable
^Look for start/end in app.js
2. When user clicks upload, sudoku board is created. If sudoku is not solvable, the upload button is not clickable.
3. Format buttons over user sudoku grid
4. Timer with normal variables instead of using state (since i dont render them anyways)
